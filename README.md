# thm-dns
an experimental dns server that resolves [tryhackme](https://tryhackme.com) room names to ips (i.e. anthem.thm -> 10.10.xxx.xxx)

note that you:
 - will need to run this as root if you want it to bind to port 53.
 - if using the dockerfile, you need to set up the config.json file beforehand as you can't do it once the docker container is built

to deploy this using docker, you can run `yarn build` or `npm run build` and then `yarn deploy` or `npm run deploy` and hopefully it works

to use this server only while connected to the THM VPN, you can add `dhcp-option DNS 127.0.0.1` to your THM OpenVPN config and it'll set it up automagically ðŸ¤·
